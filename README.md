# Border-Patrol-Terminal-Game
A simple game about playing as a border patrol agent. This was a small project meant for learning about python and a bit about python's functions. There are also reading functions for the possabilities of DLC.  Feel free to play around with it, either with the game or the code, but I would personally like credit if you do so.
